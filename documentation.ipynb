    "[Identifying a Need: Think about a problem or need that your game or simulation will address. Clearly define this need.]: #\n",
    "## **Need:** \n",
    "##### Need: To develop faster hand-eye coordination and motor skills through an engaging and interactive game that also promotes spatial awareness and good decision making.\n",
    "##### Problem Statement: Teenagers need fun and educational activities that enhance their motor skills and hand-eye coordination. A 2D platformer game that requires players to navigate obstacles and calculate game conditions (e.g. gravity, speed, air time) can help develop these skills while keeping them entertained.\n",
    "##### Skill Development: I have already developed the skills needed to create a 2D Unity Platformer game. If I need any help, I can consult Unity tutorials online. (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGOVe_adFMc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcranVQUQ5U&list=PLgOEwFbvGm5o8hayFB6skAfa8Z-mw4dPV)\n",

    "[Requirements Outline: Break your project down into five key components - Inputs, Processing, Outputs, Transmission and Storage. You will then need to list the required components for each. The Task lets you know what I need you to add, the Instructions gives you more details on how. The following provides some examples for a Game:]: #\n",
    "## **Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Identify what data or inputs your project will need from users or the environment.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: List the inputs, such as keyboard commands, mouse clicks, or sensor data (if applicable).]: #\n",
    "[Example: User inputs will include directional keyboard keys for character movement and spacebar for jumping.]: #\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "##### My game will accept mouse clicks at the splash screen and keyboard commands (up, down, left, right) during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Describe what processing needs to happen once the inputs are received. What calculations or logic will your program follow?]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Outline how the system will process the inputs.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The program will check for collisions, calculate the new position of the player, and update the game score accordingly.]: #\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "##### My program will check for collisions and calculate the new position of the player after every input.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Define what the user will see or experience after processing.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: List the outputs, such as screen updates, sounds, or messages.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The game will display the player's score, character's position, and a game-over message.]: #\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "##### My game will display the character's position, and a game-over message after specific inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Identify any data that needs to be saved, either locally or in the cloud.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Consider if the project will store game progress, user settings, or other important information.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The game will store the user's progress and high score locally.]: #\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "##### My project will not store the game progress and I am not making any user settings. The game itself will be stored in the me-drive in the school computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "[These describe what the system should do â€” the essential functions your game or simulation must perform. You do NOT need to include ALL of these. They are just EXAMPLES - include what is RELEVANT to your project, and add any others you can think of. ]: #\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Determine how the user will interact with the system.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Clearly define how users will interact with your project, whether through keyboard commands, mouse clicks, touch gestures, or other inputs. Describe the actions the user can perform (e.g., move a character, select an option, input data). Be specific about what happens when the user provides an input (e.g., pressing a button results in a specific response from the system).]: #\n",
    "### User Interaction\n",
    "##### The users will interact with my project through mouse clicks in the splash screen and keyboard commands while playing in the levels. Left click will select and activate the trigger boxes - similar to websites. Left/right buttons and AD keys move the character horizontally while the W key, up button or space bar will cause the character to jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Identify and describe the core actions or operations of your project.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: List the main actions or functions the system will perform in response to user inputs or events. For a game, think about mechanics like movement, combat, solving puzzles, etc. For a simulation, focus on key processes like data calculations, simulating real-world events, or visualization of scenarios. Outline the step-by-step flow of how these mechanics will work.]: #\n",
    "### Core Gameplay\n",
    "##### In the splashscreen, clicking on the play button will start a new game for the user and the quit button will exit the player from the game. In the game, the A/left button will make the character go left, the D/right button will make the character go right and the W/up button/space bar will make the character jump. If the character touches the spikes, it will respawn at the last checkpoint. If the character touches the portal at the end of the game, it will take the character to the splash screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Describe how the system will give feedback to the user or track progress.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Specify if there will be any form of scoring system, progress tracking, or feedback (e.g., score updates, messages for correct/incorrect actions). Indicate what triggers these feedback responses (e.g., completing a task or solving a challenge).]: #\n",
    "### Scoring and Feedback (if applicable)\n",
    "##### During the game, the player will be sent back \n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Explain how your game or simulation will progress from one stage to another.]: #\n",

    "### Performance Requirements\n",
    "##### \n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Consider how easy your system is for users to understand and navigate.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Think about the user interface (UI) and how intuitive it is for players or users. Mention any requirements for instructions, tutorials, or on-screen prompts that will help guide users.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The simulation should include a clear, beginner-friendly tutorial to explain the core mechanics to first-time users.]: #\n",
    "### Usability Requirements\n",
    "##### \n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Ensure your project works across the necessary devices and platforms.]: #\n",

    "[Example: All user data will be encrypted and stored securely to ensure privacy.]: #\n",
    "### Security Requirements\n",
    "##### \n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Specify how reliable your system needs to be and how often it should be available.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Indicate how often the system should be accessible and online if your project involves network services. Describe how you will handle potential issues like system crashes or data loss.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The system should be available 99% of the time, with error handling for network disruptions to prevent data loss.]: #\n",
