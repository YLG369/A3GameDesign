    "[Identifying a Need: Think about a problem or need that your game or simulation will address. Clearly define this need.]: #\n",
    "## **Need:** \n",
    "##### Need: To develop faster hand-eye coordination and motor skills through an engaging and interactive game that also promotes spatial awareness and good decision making.\n",
    "##### Problem Statement: Teenagers need fun and educational activities that enhance their motor skills and hand-eye coordination. A 2D platformer game that requires users to navigate obstacles and calculate game conditions (e.g. gravity, speed, air time) can help develop these skills while keeping them entertained.\n",
    "##### Skill Development: I have already developed the skills needed to create a 2D Unity Platformer game. If I need any help, I can consult Unity tutorials online. (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGOVe_adFMc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcranVQUQ5U&list=PLgOEwFbvGm5o8hayFB6skAfa8Z-mw4dPV)\n",

    "[Requirements Outline: Break your project down into five key components - Inputs, Processing, Outputs, Transmission and Storage. You will then need to list the required components for each. The Task lets you know what I need you to add, the Instructions gives you more details on how. The following provides some examples for a Game:]: #\n",
    "## **Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Identify what data or inputs your project will need from users or the environment.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: List the inputs, such as keyboard commands, mouse clicks, or sensor data (if applicable).]: #\n",
    "[Example: User inputs will include directional keyboard keys for user movement and spacebar for jumping.]: #\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "##### My game will accept mouse clicks at the splash screen and keyboard commands (up, down, left, right) during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Describe what processing needs to happen once the inputs are received. What calculations or logic will your program follow?]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Outline how the system will process the inputs.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The program will check for collisions, calculate the new position of the user, and update the game score accordingly.]: #\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "##### My program will check for collisions and calculate the new position of the user after every input.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Define what the user will see or experience after processing.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: List the outputs, such as screen updates, sounds, or messages.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The game will display the user's score, usern, and a game-over message.]: #\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "##### My game will display the usersition, and a game-over message after specific inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Identify any data that needs to be saved, either locally or in the cloud.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Consider if the project will store game progress, user settings, or other important information.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The game will store the user's progress and high score locally.]: #\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "##### My project will not store the game progress and I am not making any user settings. The game itself will be stored in the me-drive in the school computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "[These describe what the system should do — the essential functions your game or simulation must perform. You do NOT need to include ALL of these. They are just EXAMPLES - include what is RELEVANT to your project, and add any others you can think of. ]: #\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Determine how the user will interact with the system.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Clearly define how users will interact with your project, whether through keyboard commands, mouse clicks, touch gestures, or other inputs. Describe the actions the user can perform (e.g., move a usern option, input data). Be specific about what happens when the user provides an input (e.g., pressing a button results in a specific response from the system).]: #\n",
    "### User Interaction\n",
    "##### The users will interact with my project through mouse clicks in the splash screen and keyboard commands while playing in the levels. Left click will select and activate the trigger boxes - similar to websites. Left/right buttons and AD keys move the userlly while the W key, up button or space bar will cause the charauserump.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Identify and describe the core actions or operations of your project.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: List the main actions or functions the system will perform in response to user inputs or events. For a game, think about mechanics like movement, combat, solving puzzles, etc. For a simulation, focus on key processes like data calculations, simulating real-world events, or visualization of scenarios. Outline the step-by-step flow of how these mechanics will work.]: #\n",
    "### Core Gameplay\n",
    "##### In the splashscreen, clicking on the play button will start a new game for the user and the quit button will exit the user from the game. In the game, the A/left button will make the usereft, the D/right button will make the useright and the W/up button/space bar will make the userthe usern at the last checkpoint. If the user touches the poruserme, it will take the user to the splash screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Describe how the system will give feedback to the user or track progress.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Specify if there will be any form of scoring system, progress tracking, or feedback (e.g., score updates, messages for correct/incorrect actions). Indicate what triggers these feedback responses (e.g., completing a task or solving a challenge).]: #\n",
    "### Scoring, Feedback and Level Progression\n",
    "##### During the game, the user will be sent back to the last checkpoint, each checkpoint having a corresponding number. When the game starts a timer is displayed at the top left corner of the user's viewing screen. The program can only end when the user has completed/touched all the checkpoints. Completion of the game will result in a message and after clicking the message, the program will loop back to the splash screen. To pause and exit the game there will be a pause button at the top right corner of the user's viewing screen. After clicking pause, the user is given two options: Continue or Quit. By triggering Quit, the user is sent back to the splash screen and by clicking Continue, the user resumes the game. No progress or score is saved whatsoever and the no feedback given to the user if Quit is triggered.\n",

    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Define how quickly and efficiently the system should operate.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Set goals for how fast the system should load, how smoothly it should run, and how responsive the controls or interactions should feel.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The game should load in under 3 seconds and respond to user inputs instantly, without noticeable lag.]: #\n",
    "### Performance Requirements\n",
    "##### After the Unity intro, my game should load in less than half a second and start responding to user inputs instanty, without any noticeable lag. Animations should be running at 12 frames per second and there should be no auditory output.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Consider how easy your system is for users to understand and navigate.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Think about the user interface (UI) and how intuitive it is for user instructions, tutorials, or on-screen prompts that will help guide users.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The simulation should include a clear, beginner-friendly tutorial to explain the core mechanics to first-time users.]: #\n",
    "### Usability Requirements\n",
    "##### My game was designed for teenagers and young adults but a healthy literate person of any age should be able to operate my game. There will be instructions to assist the user up to the first checkpoint and all texts and arrows should be easy to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Ensure your project works across the necessary devices and platforms.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Specify the platforms your project must run on, such as PC, mobile, or web browsers. If your project is designed for multiple platforms, explain how it will adapt (e.g., touch controls for mobile, mouse/keyboard for PC).]: #\n",
    "[Example: The game must be compatible with both Android and iOS devices, using touch controls for interaction.]: #\n",
    "### Compatibility Requirements\n",
    "##### The game must be compatible with all devices that accept mouse clicks, up/left/right buttons and/or space bar and/or A/W/D buttons. My game was made with Unity so it should run with any of the above software that is compatible with Unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Plan for the possibility of expanding your project in the future.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Think about how the system can handle additional features, levels, or users as it grows.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The game should be able to scale to include additional levels without impacting performance.]: #\n",
    "### Scalability Requirements\n",
    "##### The game should be able to scale up to include additional levels without impacting performance. It should also be able to include more sprites, backgrounds and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Task: Specify how reliable your system needs to be and how often it should be available.]: #\n",
    "[Instructions: Indicate how often the system should be accessible and online if your project involves network services. Describe how you will handle potential issues like system crashes or data loss.]: #\n",
    "[Example: The system should be available 99% of the time, with error handling for network disruptions to prevent data loss.]: #\n",
    "### Reliability and Availability\n",
    "##### The system should be available all the time as long as the device is compatible with Unity because my game doesn't save any data or progress. \n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consideration of Social and Ethical Issues\n",
    "##### Equity: the quality of being fair and impartial\n",

    "\n",
    "[Consideration: Will your project be usable by people of all abilities?]: #\n",
    "[Guidance: Ensure your project includes features like subtitles, alternative controls, or visual adjustments to accommodate users with disabilities.]: #\n",
    "### Accessibility\n",
    "##### My program will be worded with a bold and clear font to make all the subtitles easy to read and it will assist users by guiding them through the first level with clear instructions. My program will also offer encouragement to the user at each checkpoint. Left or right hand can be used depending on user preference. The A/left button will make the user go left, the D/right button will make the user go right and the W/up button/space bar will make the user jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Consideration: Could your game or simulation affect users’ mental health?]: #\n",
    "[Guidance: Avoid distressing content and make sure the game promotes a positive experience (e.g., avoid excessive violence or manipulation).]: #\n",
    "### Mental and Emotional Well-Being\n",
    "##### My game does not contain any violence or manipulation and I believe it promotes a positive experience. My program may cause seizures and in severe cases, crashing out as my game is designed to be impossible to complete."
