    "You need to decide exactly what it is you are going to create. The only limitation is that it must be a Game or Simulation. This could mean a whole variety of things. The following are some examples, but not an exhaustive list. I will include links to tutorials I have found for some. Remember, you CAN do something entirely different. The important thing is that it is highly interactive for the user, and is a Game or Simulation. \n",
